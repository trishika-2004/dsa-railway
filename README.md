# DSA Railway Problem ðŸš†

This project solves a Railway Management problem using Python and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This script demonstrates the use of data structures (like arrays, queues, stacks, or graphs â€“ depending on what your code uses) to simulate railway operations such as train scheduling, track allocation, or coach management.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- Python 3
- DSA concepts

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
- `dsa railway.py` â€“ Main Python script containing the logic

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trishika-2004/dsa-railway.git
cd dsa-railway
python "dsa railway.py"
